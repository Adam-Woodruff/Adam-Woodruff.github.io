                        During lockdown I wanted to improve my rusty programming skills 
                        in preparation for my A levels as, I knew now was as good a time 
                        as any with over 6 months off school.  With this free time, I wanted 
                        to something to push my skills that was still within reason. This 
                        being the case after researching what other people have made at a 
                        similar skill level to me I decided to make a program that solves 
                        sudoku boards. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To start with I looked at what other people had done to get an idea 
                        on how this problem could be solved. I found that the most affective way
                        to my knowledge was using backtracking. Solving as much of the board as 
                        possible and going back if no numbers from 1-9 fit. In my program i wanted 
                        to include a algorithm that generated boards that could be solved. But this 
                        proved more hard than anticipated. Whilst I did struggle with this i 
                        found a work-around but my main objective for this project was to pick up 
                        lost habits and create a well written program.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I spent about a week creating this program mulling over different more 
                        efficient methods but I found, the way <a href="https://www.techwithtim.net/tutorials/python-programming/sudoku-solver-backtracking/">Tech With Tim<a>
                         did it best. So, i followed his tutorial for the most part adapting some 
                         of the code to be more organised as well as adding a menu using dictionaries
                        and the mentioned board generator. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="blog-content-wrapper">
                    <p>
                        The menu part of the code that is seemingly very simple is a part I 
                        spent quite a lot of time on. The typical if elif menu in python despite
                        being very popular is very inefficient as the program has to go through 
                        every if statement and it is also very messy. So, in my code i wanted to 
                        create a more clean and efficient menu. While this might seem simple for 
                        someone with more experience, creating the new menu (above) i found to be 
                        quite difficult to wrap my head around with use of newly introduced dictionaries. 
                        After coding, the menu proved its value and enabled me the possibility to 
                        add many more options without making my code a mess.

                <div class="blog-content-wrapper">
                    <p>
                        After coding the menu I started with the core of the project, the solving function. 
                        To do this I hard coded an empty board and following the premise of the 
                        <a href="https://www.techwithtim.net/tutorials/python-programming/sudoku-solver-backtracking/">Tech With Tim<a> 
                        tutorial i created working function that iterates through each item in the board 
                        trying numbers 1-9. 
                        Although this sounds simple, determining if a numbers works is actualy more complex 
                        than first glance. This is because for a sudoku board to work there must be no 
                        repeating numbers vertically, horizontally or in the 3x3 section of the grid. So in order 
                        for the program to find if a number works the "solve" function must call the "valid" function 
                        which checks to see if that number is valid. If the number is valid it returns True and the 
                        iterated number i is place there.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="blog-image-wrapper">

                <div class="blog-content-wrapper">
                    <p>
                        The above function generates the random board. This was the most time-consuming part of the 
                        project as I tried it multiple ways to no avail. And after about 3 days of trying, it different 
                        ways I resorted to a dubious work around. My code works by iterating 9 times and generating an 
                        array of a random length with a random number sampled from a 1-9list. These are the numbers that 
                        will be in the sudoku board. I then repeat this step but this time generating an array for the 
                        positions of the aforementioned numbers. These positions are generated by using the random sample 
                        from the 1-9 list but this time with the same length as the numbers. Each list is then passed the 
                        valid function to be checked and see if the number can be placed there. After the board is 
                        assembled the result is a board with no guarantee that is can be solved. This is because while the 
                        board is empty the numbers work as there are very few that would cause conflict. But as the board 
                        is solved numbers placed by the user could cause conflict making the board impossible. My solution 
                        to this while not the best was to run the random board function the necessary times to generate a 
                        board that works. While this is not ideal i had spent so much time on the project i was getting 
                        tired of the same problem so decided to cut my losses are start another project.

                        seemingly instantly. While i am happy with the outcome of this project i would in the future 
                        like to come back to this project to fix some of the errors and make it more stream lined.
                        In total i spent about 6 hours over a fortnight coding this project and while that may seem 
                        like a lot for a simple project this was my first time coding in over a year and my main 
                        objective was to just refresh my skills.
