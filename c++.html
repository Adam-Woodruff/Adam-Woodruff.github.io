                        To better my knowledge in computer science over lockdown of 2020 I decided I 
                        should attempt to broaden my horizon and learn a new language, so I though what 
                        better language to learn than what is commonly regarded as the hardest. Not knowing 
                        this at the time I looked around the internet for some tutorials on how to make basic 
                        applications. To start my journey, I created a keylogger making use of C++â€™s built 
                        in keypress functions. This useless program taught me not only some of the very basics, 
                        but also that learning C++ was going to be much harder that I played it out to be. After 
                        completing this project, I followed a tutorial teaching how to make a simple game of 
                        snake. This gave me some very valuable insight showing me more techniques I would 
                        not have used otherwise like switch statements and displaying how pointers would 
                        be used in context. Taking longer than expected I finished the project now hungry 
                        to try code something of my own. My plan was to create a simple graph tool. This 
                        would make used of my newly learned switch statements and for loop format to plot 
                        a graph of a polynomial on to the terminal window.
