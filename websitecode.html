                    <p>In the spirit of trying to make my self more appealing to employers and universities in January of 2021 
                        I set out on creating my own website. The main reason behind this being to display some of my programming 
                        projects as well as making a home for my cv. While I knew some basic HTML and CSS through my A level 
                        computer science course creating a good-looking website seemed out of the question. Despite this after 
                        about a few weeks completing the Free Code Camp web design course refreshing my knowledge, I managed to 
                        create the bones of my static website. As well as following typical design practice I also wanted to 
                        base the structure of my website around a few core things - </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Display my 3D modelling portfolio without long loading times.</li>
                        <li>Show case more advanced techniques.</li>
                        <li>Make sure the site is as user friendly as possible.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This in mind I slowly started adding more and more building out the website making sure to use good 
                        etiquette while developing and keeping a consistent colour scheme To make the home page I used CSS 
                        grid. I found using this to be very helpful as it enables vast amounts of flexibility. In each grid 
                        I used an image this has two purposes, to act as a navigation hub and to show case some renders I 
                        have made. I feel my use of CSS grid at the top of the home page catches a viewerâ€™s attention attention 
                        and show I have put effort the thought into it. For the images to be used for navigation they needed 
                        to have text saying where they would take you to. To do this I added a CSS transition that fades 
                        the images using the filter brightness function. I then added another transition to the text making 
                        it fade into view. The result I feel to be quite aesthetically appealing and is easily navigable. 
                        Using a similar approach, I designed the layout of my other pages again using CSS grid to keep each 
                        page tidy.
                    </p>
                    <div class="blog-image-wrapper">
                        <img src="assets/website/portfolio.png" alt="IMAGE">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        To ensure loading times are as short as possible particularly on the <a href="portfolio.html"> 3D portfolio page</a> 
                        I made sure to use lower resolution images. To help with this I also added a loading screen, despite not helping 
                        with the loading times this does keep the viewers attention.<br> While I understand that making a static website 
                        is not rocket science, I am still very happy with the result of this website. I have surpassed my personal expectations.  
                        Being my first site it is by no means perfect but is feel I have created a good looking website that does exactly 
                        what I need it to do.
                    </p>
                    <div class="blog-image-wrapper">
                        <img src="assets/website/apache.png" alt="IMAGE">
                    </div>
                    <p>After finishing the website, I needed a means of hosting it. I had many options for this but firstly I wanted to 
                        try hosting is on my raspberry pi using apache. This was relatively straight forward taking about 20 minutes to 
                        set up. I found the best part about apache was how easy it was to manage. To update the website, I could just use 
                        the SCP command built into windows to transfer the files from my desktop to the raspberry pi, then using SSH I 
                        could restart apache all in all taking less than 3 minutes. While it was very convenient to host on a raspberry 
                        pi there were a few draw backs. Firstly, my area has very bad internet meaning loading times were very long. I had 
                        also read about security concerns on the latest apache version. This combined put me off as I just could not justify 
                        it when there were much better free alternatives. Next, I tried what I am using now, GitHub pages, this solution 
                        has worked very well. The reason I prefer this solution to apache is because updating the website is as easy as 
                        pushing the changes to the git repository and refreshing the browser. Combined with the fast loading times makes 
                        this a far superior option The Github student pack also enables me to get loads of free benefits including a free 
                        domain for my website.  </p>
