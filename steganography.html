                    <p>
                        Through time wasted watching YouTube videos over half term I ended up researching a lot 
                        about steganography and some of the methods used to encrypt a message into an image. This 
                        caught my interest as unlike typical encryption this message can be in plain sight yet 
                        invisible. So inevitably I wanted to create my own version and the first step of this was 
                        to plan it out deciding on what method I was going to use to encrypt the message. I decided 
                        to use the least significant bit method partly because it is one of the simplest and most 
                        easy to implement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Least significant bit works by taking the last bit of each RGB value of every pixel in an 
                        image and changing it to part of the binary value for an ASCII character. This means each 
                        pixel can have up to 3 bits of secret data stored. The way the code does this is by taking 
                        the image and opening it into a numpy array using the Pillow image module. Here the image 
                        is split into a 3D array with each RBG value nested into X and Y arrays. I then took the 
                        user input and split it to binary and looped through each individual value taking the image 
                        array and comparing the corresponding binary value of the RBG channels. To change the bits, 
                        I used python’s built-in bitwise operators I first compared the two values, if they are the 
                        same, I did not change them else I flipped the image array bit. This was repeated for each 
                        binary value until the whole image was encoded. In making this program I encountered a few 
                        difficulties, for example in black and white pixels I first had to check if the RGB value 
                        was greater than 1 and less than 254 otherwise the program could add 1 to 255 causing it 
                        to overflow and vice versa for black. I also had to make sure the program knew when to stop 
                        otherwise it would turn each pixel to a character even if not encoded. To do this when 
                        encoding I added 8 0’s. This meant when decoding it was easy to identify when the message 
                        had stopped as when the mod of the length was 0 and the last 8 bits where 0’s the program 
                        could stop.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once the whole image had been encoded, I then used python pillow to reconstruct the image 
                        from the new modified array resulting in a nearly identical image. In practice the change 
                        in the images I so small the only practical way to detect the change would be to hash both 
                        images and look for change in that. And while this is not the most secure and practical way 
                        of sending a message creating this project was quite enjoyable as it posed some unique 
                        problems. All in all, I would say I did a good job but like most things there is always a 
                        better way of doing something.
