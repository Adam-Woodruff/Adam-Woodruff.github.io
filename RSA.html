                    <p>To Aid in my computer science project in my spare time I decided to endeavour in programming my version of the widely used, RSA encryption algorithm. To get a basic idea of how I could go about doing this I watched videos of the maths behind how it works. This I found to be very useful particularly the videos from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xDGSalpPXk&list=PL5KkMZvBpo5CdoOxa3dqll2n6KsXqerYO">Eddie Woo.</a></p>
                    <p>After gaining the knowledge of how the algorithm works, I began piecing it together. Firstly, I started by generating the prime numbers used for the key. I did this by generating a random odd number checking to see if it was prime and if it wasn’t I added 2 and repeated until I found one. While this is most likely not the most efficient way it works in reasonable time for my use case. To check if the random number is prime, I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat_primality_test"> Fermats test for primality </a> this test is thoroughly explained elsewhere on the internet but in general it is better to run the test multiple times as there is a small chance the test gives a false positive with specific numbers. </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>When calculating large powers, the most popular method of calculation is typically modular exponentiation. While there is a built-in python function to do this that is almost certainly faster, I wanted to program my own function just to fully understand how it works. </p>
                    <p>To generate the public key I followed the documented method as learnt from research. The public key must be between 1 and the number of co-primes of the two prime number generated while also being co-prime with the two primes number multiplied. </p>
                    <p>Example:<br><br>P = 11, q = 13 <br><br> 5 x 7 = 143 <br><br> (11-1) (13-1) = 120 <br><br>Φ(n) = 120<br><br>This shows us there are no common factors between 7, 143 and 120 making them co-prime.<br><br>1 < 7 < 120 <br><br>So, 7 is our public key <br><br>The equation to find the private key makes use of both the public key and n so that it satisfies the equation </p>
