                    <p>To Aid in my computer science project in my spare time I decided to endeavour in programming my version of the widely used, RSA encryption algorithm. To get a basic idea of how I could go about doing this I watched videos of the maths behind how it works. This I found to be very useful particularly the videos from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xDGSalpPXk&list=PL5KkMZvBpo5CdoOxa3dqll2n6KsXqerYO">Eddie Woo.</a></p>
                    <p>After gaining the knowledge of how the algorithm works, I began piecing it together. Firstly, I started by generating the prime numbers used for the key. I did this by generating a random odd number checking to see if it was prime and if it wasn’t I added 2 and repeated until I found one. While this is most likely not the most efficient way it works in reasonable time for my use case. To check if the random number is prime, I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat_primality_test"> Fermats test for primality </a> this test is thoroughly explained elsewhere on the internet but in general it is better to run the test multiple times as there is a small chance the test gives a false positive with specific numbers. </p>

                    <p>When calculating large powers, the most popular method of calculation is typically modular exponentiation. While there is a built-in python function to do this that is almost certainly faster, I wanted to program my own function just to fully understand how it works. </p>
                    <p>To generate the privatekey I followed the documented method as learnt from research. The public key must be between 1 and the number of co-primes of the two prime number generated while also being co-prime with the two primes number multiplied. </p>
                    <p>Example:<br><br>P = 11, q = 13 <br><br> 5 x 7 = 143 <br><br> (11-1) (13-1) = 120 <br><br>Φ(n) = 120<br><br>This shows us there are no common factors between 7, 143 and 120 making them co-prime.<br><br>1 < 7 < 120 <br><br>So, 7 is our public key <br><br>The equation to find the private key makes use of both the public key and n so that it satisfies the equation </p>
                    <p>After the private key had been generated, I used the extended Euclidean algorithm to calculate the public key. This calculates the greatest common divisor of p and q. The result from this function was the working public key.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>After the keys had been generated it is now just interpreting the input and encoding it using the keys. when using RSA encryption is the same process and decryption just with different keys, Because of this I made use of one function called conversion. This function used modular exponentiation to speed up the process of following the RSA formula for encryption and decryption.</p>

                    <p>Example:<br><br>Public key = (7, 143) <br><br>Plain text – Hello World <br><br>Ascii equivalent – 72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 87, 111, 114, 108, 100 <br><br>727 mod(143) = 19 <br>1017 mod(143) = 26 <br>1087 mod(143) = 4 <br>1087 mod(143) = 4 <br>1117 mod(143) = 45<br> 327 mod(143) = 98<br> 877 mod(143) = 87<br> 1117 mod(143) = 45<br> 1147 mod(143) = 49<br> 1087 mod(143) = 4<br> 1007 mod(143) = 100<br><br> Cypher text – 19, 26, 4, 4, 45, 98, 87, 45, 49, 4, 100 </p>
                    <p>While this is an over simplified depiction of everything necessary to make this program work, I hope is has shed a bit of light as to my approach to the problem and how I tackled it.<br>You can find the code for this project on my <a href="https://github.com/Adam-Woodruff/RSA-Encryption">Github page</a></p>
