                    <p>
                        While covering my A level maths course I found the best way to break down and 
                        understand the topic was to code to function. Doing this helped me to fully 
                        understand the steps as I broke the function down into its most simple aspects. 
                        Particularly with standard deviation, as when I coded it, it helped me to fully 
                        understand how each part of the equation impacts the results. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Standard Deviation</h2>

                    </div>
                    <P>
                        To code this standard deviation function I first started by asking the user to 
                        input whether they want to use a frequency of 1 or a variable frequency. This 
                        choice meant the application was more useful. Firstly, I coded the linear function 
                        to do this is first started by getting the user to input the length of the list 
                        and assigning that number to a variable. I then got the user to enter the list 
                        of numbers one by one and appending that number to a list. Then following the 
                        formula, I found the mean of the list and subtracted that mean from every item 
                        in the number list and squaring the result. This result I again appended into a 
                        new list and found the square root of the sum of new list divided by the length 
                        of the it. The result is the standard deviation of the list that the user inputted.
                    </P>

                    <p>
                        I used the same method to find the standard deviation of a variable frequency list. 
                        The only difference being that I asked the user for the frequency of each item and 
                        used that to calculate the standard deviation. Overall, my program works, but is not 
                        very practical in the real work as my graphical calculator can calculate it with a 
                        user interface. But the program served its purpose teaching me on a deeper level how 
                        standard deviation works.

                    <p>I also created a program that calculated the discriminant. This was very simple as I 
                        just followed the formula b^2-4ac from the inputted polynomial this project was partly 
                        just to do some programming.
