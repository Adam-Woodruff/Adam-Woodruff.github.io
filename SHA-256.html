                    <p>To broaden my horizons in the world of computer science and following on from my recent 
                        interest in encryption I endeavoured in creating my own python implementation of the 
                        SHA-256 algorithm. From what I understand SHA-256 is among the most secure hashing 
                        algorithms that exist. At its core, a hashing algorithm takes text of any length and 
                        following the algorithm converts it into a unique 256-bit string of hexadecimal characters. 
                        The main selling point being that this cryptographic function is impossible to reverse 
                        given the hash and given current technology it would take on of the worlds fastest 
                        super computers over <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-long-would-it-take-to-crack-SHA-256">(1.1 * 10 ^ 57) years</a> 
                        Its most popular applications include bitcoin and data security 
                    </p>
                    <p>To code the algorithm, I first had to fully understand the deeper working of it what 
                        happens to the data when inputted. To do this I read through lots of sources and watches 
                        a handful of videos one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9EbD6iY9zI"> video 
                        particularly helpful</a> help me understand how the functions like choice and 
                        majority are used with real data. But to make sure my hash algorithm was up to 
                        standard I tried my best to follow <a href=https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf> 
                        the federal standards.</a> This also showed me how some of the functions can be written 
                        more simply using bit operations.

                        The code is structured so as that it asks for the use to input ascii txt. It then 
                        converts it to a byte-array, adds 64 bits to mark the length of the message and pads 
                        the message to a multiple of 512 bits. This message is then split into an array of 64 
                        bit “words”. Next the program begins creating the message schedule, to do this it loops 
                        t through 64 times (as there needs to be 64 words) doing this It applies the specific 
                        functions sigma0 and sigma1 to their respective words and appends it to the message.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Next the program initialises the working values calculated by doing the square root of 
                        the first 8 prime numbers assigning each value as an item as a list. Then the program 
                        works through the 64 words working its way through item by item doing the functions 
                        Uppercase Sigma 0 and Uppercase Sigma 1 to their respective words. After the program 
                        has looped through every word the program then loops through 8 times adding each item 
                        pair, appending itself to create a list and being converted to hex to result in a hash 
                        string.

                        While this is extremely oversimplified the basic premise is the same.<br>
